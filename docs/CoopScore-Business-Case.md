# CoopScore: AI-Powered Cooperative Credit Scoring Platform

## Business Case & Revenue Model

**Prepared for:** OIC Stakeholders & Partners
**Date:** February 2026
**Version:** 1.0

---

## Executive Summary

CoopScore is an AI-powered credit scoring platform purpose-built for Philippine cooperatives. It addresses a critical gap in the cooperative lending ecosystem: the lack of formal, data-driven credit assessment tools for cooperative members, many of whom are thin-file borrowers without traditional credit histories.

The Philippine cooperative sector manages **PHP 623 billion in assets** across **20,105 registered cooperatives** serving **12.1 million members**. Despite this scale, credit assessment remains largely manual and committee-based, resulting in high default rates, slow loan processing, and inconsistent risk evaluation.

CoopScore replaces this with a 7-dimension scoring engine, AI-driven loan interviews in local languages (English, Bisaya, Filipino), and intelligent risk analysis — all accessible through a modern web platform.

**No competing product exists** that combines AI credit scoring with cooperative-specific data dimensions and multilingual support for the Philippine market.

## 1. The Problem

### 1.1 How Cooperatives Assess Credit Today

Most Philippine cooperatives evaluate loan applications using the "4 Cs" framework (Character, Capacity, Circumstances, Collateral) applied through manual committee review. This process suffers from:

- **Inconsistency**: Different committees reach different conclusions on similar applications
- **Slowness**: Loan approvals take days or weeks due to manual review cycles
- **Bias**: Personal relationships influence decisions, either positively or negatively
- **No external visibility**: Cooperatives cannot see what members owe to other lenders, leading to over-indebtedness
- **Thin-file exclusion**: New members or those without formal financial histories are difficult to evaluate fairly

### 1.2 The Consequences

- Philippine cooperative default rates are **nearly triple the Asian average** (BIS data)
- Rural and cooperative bank non-performing loans reached **PHP 15 billion**
- Members borrow from multiple cooperatives simultaneously without disclosure
- 77.3% of cooperatives are classified as micro or small, with limited capacity to absorb losses from bad lending decisions

### 1.3 Regulatory Pressure

The regulatory environment is pushing cooperatives toward formalized credit assessment:

| Regulation | Requirement |
|------------|-------------|
| **RA 9510 (CISA)** | Mandatory credit data submission to the Credit Information Corporation (CIC) |
| **CDA MC 2024-07** | Comprehensive guidelines for cooperative credit operations, including risk management |
| **CDA MC 2019-01** | Required quarterly credit data submission with penalties up to PHP 1,000,000 for non-compliance |

Cooperatives that fail to comply face administrative fines of **PHP 25,000 to PHP 1,000,000** per violation and potential criminal penalties of **1 to 5 years imprisonment**.

---

## 2. The Solution: CoopScore

### 2.1 Platform Overview

CoopScore is a cloud-based platform that provides:

**Credit Scoring Engine**
A 7-dimension model designed specifically for cooperative lending, incorporating data points that traditional credit bureaus ignore:

| Dimension | Weight | What It Measures |
|-----------|--------|------------------|
| Repayment History | 25% | Payment patterns, timeliness, defaults |
| Loan Utilization | 15% | Borrowing behavior and utilization ratios |
| Capital Buildup | 15% | Savings growth, share capital accumulation |
| Membership Maturity | 10% | Length and consistency of coop membership |
| Cooperative Engagement | 10% | Participation in assemblies, training, governance |
| Demographics | 10% | Employment stability, income, household factors |
| Guarantor Network | 15% | Strength and reliability of guarantor relationships |

**AI-Powered Features (Claude)**

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Multilingual Loan Interview** | Guided AI interview in English, Bisaya, or Filipino that evaluates borrower understanding across 5 required topics |
| **Narrative Analysis** | AI assessment of loan purpose clarity, alignment with borrower profile, and risk flags — integrated with interview findings |
| **Score Explainer** | Plain-language explanations of credit score components for officers and members |
| **What-If Coach** | Simulates how specific actions would improve a member's credit score |
| **Anomaly Detection** | Flags unusual patterns in scoring or member activity |

**Thin-File Support**
A progressive scoring ladder that fairly evaluates members with limited credit history, ensuring new members are not automatically excluded from lending consideration while maintaining appropriate risk controls.

---

## 4. Competitive Landscape

### 4.1 No Direct Competitor Exists

No product in the Philippine market combines AI-powered credit scoring with cooperative-specific data dimensions. The closest alternatives serve different segments:

| Company | What They Do | Why They Don't Compete |
|---------|-------------|----------------------|
| **NATCCO eKoopBanker** | Core banking and accounting for 250+ cooperatives | No credit scoring engine, no AI capabilities |
| **DigiCoop (Traxion)** | Cloud core banking and POS for cooperatives | No AI scoring, no thin-file support |
| **FinScore** | Telco-based credit scores (15M+ delivered) | Serves banks, not cooperatives directly |
| **Credolab** | Smartphone behavioral scoring | Enterprise-only, bank-focused, no coop integration |
| **TransUnion/1CISP** | Credit bureau data for cooperatives | Bureau reporting only, not an AI scoring engine |
| **CRIF Philippines** | Credit bureau scoring | Focused on banks and large financial institutions |

**Globally**, Zest AI serves US credit unions (the closest analogue) but does not operate in the Philippines or Southeast Asia.

### 4.2 Strategic Positioning

CoopScore is **complementary** to existing cooperative software, not a replacement:

- eKoopBanker handles accounting and transaction processing; CoopScore handles credit intelligence
- DigiCoop provides core banking infrastructure; CoopScore provides risk analytics
- TransUnion provides external credit data; CoopScore provides internal scoring and AI assessment

This positioning enables partnerships rather than competition.

## 5. Revenue Model

### 5.1 Pricing Structure: Tiered SaaS + AI Usage

**Base Subscription (by cooperative size):**

| Tier | Member Capacity | Monthly Fee | Annual Fee | Includes |
|------|----------------|-------------|------------|---------|
| Starter | Up to 500 | PHP 5,000 | PHP 55,000 | Scoring engine, member and loan management, 3 users |
| Growth | Up to 2,000 | PHP 15,000 | PHP 165,000 | + Reports, activity tracking, anomaly detection, 10 users |
| Professional | Up to 10,000 | PHP 35,000 | PHP 385,000 | + All AI features, unlimited users |
| Enterprise | 10,000+ | PHP 75,000+ | PHP 825,000+ | + Custom integrations, SLA, dedicated support |

*Annual pricing reflects a ~8% discount for annual commitment.*

**AI Feature Add-Ons (for Starter and Growth tiers):**

| Feature | Per-Use Price | AI API Cost | Gross Margin |
|---------|--------------|-------------|-------------|
| AI Loan Interview | PHP 50 | PHP 7 | 86% |
| Narrative Analysis | PHP 10 | PHP 0.33 | 97% |
| Score Explainer | PHP 5 | PHP 0.55 | 89% |
| What-If Coach | PHP 5 | PHP 0.44 | 91% |

### 5.2 Unit Economics

**Cost to serve one cooperative (200 members, 50 loans/month):**

| Cost Component | Monthly |
|----------------|---------|
| AI API costs (Claude) | PHP 440 (~$8) |
| Cloud infrastructure (hosting, database) | PHP 500-1,000 |
| **Total COGS** | **~PHP 1,500** |

At a Growth tier subscription of PHP 15,000/month, this represents a **gross margin exceeding 90%**.

**AI costs at scale:**

| Scale | Cooperatives | Members | Monthly AI Cost |
|-------|-------------|---------|----------------|
| Pilot | 1 | 200 | PHP 440 |
| Regional | 10 | 2,000 | PHP 4,400 |
| Growth | 50 | 10,000 | PHP 22,000 |
| National | 200 | 40,000 | PHP 88,000 |

AI infrastructure costs remain negligible relative to subscription revenue at every scale.

### 5.3 Revenue Projections

**Conservative scenario (5% market penetration in 3 years):**

| Year | Cooperatives | Avg Monthly Revenue | Annual Revenue |
|------|-------------|--------------------|----|
| Year 1 | 15 | PHP 12,000 | PHP 2.16M |
| Year 2 | 80 | PHP 18,000 | PHP 17.28M |
| Year 3 | 450 | PHP 22,000 | PHP 118.8M |

## 6. Go-to-Market Strategy

### 6.1 The Federation Channel

Philippine cooperatives are organized through federations. **Federation partnerships are the primary distribution channel** — direct sales to individual cooperatives is slow and expensive.

The three key federation partners:

| Federation | Reach | Relevance |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| **MASS-SPECC** | Mindanao region | OIC is in Cagayan de Oro; MASS-SPECC has its own ICT unit distributing "Pinoy Coop" software to member cooperatives |
| **NATCCO** | 1,000+ cooperatives nationwide | Largest cooperative network; distributes eKoopBanker to 250+ cooperatives |
| **PFCCO** | Credit cooperatives nationwide | Focused specifically on credit operations |

### 6.2 Phased Rollout

**Phase 1: Prove (Months 1-6)**
- Deploy CoopScore with OIC as anchor client
- Measure and document outcomes:
  - Reduction in loan default rates
  - Loan processing time improvement
  - Number of thin-file members successfully scored
  - Officer satisfaction and adoption metrics
- Build a compelling case study with before-and-after data
- Pricing: Nominal or subsidized during pilot

**Phase 2: Regional Expansion via MASS-SPECC (Months 6-12)**
- Present OIC case study to MASS-SPECC leadership
- Negotiate distribution partnership through MASS-SPECC ICT unit
- Target 10-15 medium-to-large cooperatives in Mindanao
- Focus on cooperatives with PHP 15M+ assets (ability to pay)
- Pricing: PHP 10,000-30,000/month depending on cooperative size

**Phase 3: National Scale via NATCCO (Months 12-24)**
- Present at NATCCO General Assembly with validated regional results
- Negotiate national distribution partnership
- Position as complementary to eKoopBanker (scoring + accounting)
- Target 50+ cooperatives across Visayas and Luzon
- Pricing: Full tiered pricing with federation volume discounts

**Phase 4: Platform Expansion (Months 24+)**
- Inter-cooperative credit data sharing (addressing the multi-borrowing problem)
- CIC data submission automation (compliance value-add)
- BSP regulatory sandbox entry for alternative credit scoring validation
- Potential registration as a Technology Service Cooperative (CDA MC 2021-14)

### 6.3 Key Success Factors

1. **Federation buy-in is critical.** Cooperatives trust their federations. Partnership with MASS-SPECC and NATCCO is the fastest path to scale.
2. **Prove measurable impact.** A strong OIC case study — with specific numbers on default reduction and processing time — is the single most important sales asset.
3. **Regulatory compliance as a feature.** CDA and CIC compliance is a growing burden for cooperatives. Positioning CoopScore as a compliance enabler accelerates adoption.
4. **Cooperative values alignment.** CoopScore should be framed as infrastructure that strengthens the cooperative movement, not as a product being sold to cooperatives.
5. **Local language support matters.** Bisaya and Filipino interview capabilities are a genuine differentiator in regions where English-only tools are a barrier.

## 7. Risk Factors & Mitigation

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-----------|
| **Low technology adoption** among micro/small cooperatives | Limits addressable market | Focus on medium-to-large cooperatives first; let federations drive adoption downward |
| **Price sensitivity** in the cooperative sector | Pressure on subscription pricing | Per-use AI pricing allows smaller cooperatives to access features affordably; demonstrate clear ROI |
| **TransUnion/DigiCoop partnership** gains traction | Competitive pressure | CoopScore's AI capabilities and thin-file model are differentiated; position as complementary |
| **Data privacy concerns** with AI processing of member data | Regulatory and trust barriers | Full RA 10173 (Data Privacy Act) compliance; transparent data handling; local data residency |
| **AI cost increases** from API provider | Margin compression | Current margins exceed 90%; model-agnostic architecture allows switching providers; batch processing and caching reduce costs by 30-40% |
| **Regulatory changes** requiring specific credit scoring standards | Compliance burden | Early engagement with CDA and BSP positions CoopScore as a standard-setter rather than a follower |

---

## 8. Investment & Resource Requirements

### 8.1 Current State

CoopScore has a working MVP deployed with the following capabilities:
- Full 7-dimension credit scoring engine with thin-file support
- AI loan interview with Bisaya, Filipino, and English support
- AI narrative analysis integrated with interview findings
- Member and loan management
- Dashboard, reporting, and activity tracking
- Cloud deployment on Railway (PostgreSQL + Next.js)

### 8.2 Key Investments Needed for Commercialization

| Area | Purpose | Estimated Cost |
|------|---------|---------------|
| **Security & Compliance** | Data Privacy Act compliance, penetration testing, security audit | PHP 500K - 1M |
| **Federation Integration** | API integrations with eKoopBanker, DigiCoop, or Pinoy Coop | PHP 300K - 800K |
| **CIC Data Submission Module** | Automated credit data reporting to CIC in required formats | PHP 200K - 500K |
| **Multi-Tenant Architecture** | Support for multiple cooperatives on a single platform with data isolation | PHP 500K - 1M |
| **Sales & Partnerships** | Federation relationship building, regional representation, conference presence | PHP 300K - 600K/year |
| **Support & Operations** | Customer onboarding, training, ongoing support for partner cooperatives | PHP 200K - 400K/year |

---

## 9. Conclusion

CoopScore operates at the intersection of three converging forces:

1. **A large, underserved market** — PHP 623B in cooperative assets with 12.1M members relying on manual credit assessment
2. **Regulatory momentum** — CDA and BSP are pushing cooperatives toward formalized credit risk management and data reporting
3. **AI capability maturity** — AI-powered credit scoring, multilingual interviews, and risk analysis are now achievable at costs that make sense for cooperative-scale operations (< PHP 500/month in AI costs per cooperative)

The competitive window is open. No existing product combines AI credit scoring with cooperative-specific dimensions and local language support. Federation partnerships provide a clear, scalable distribution channel. And the unit economics — 90%+ gross margins with negligible AI costs — support a sustainable business at scale.

The recommended next step is to formalize the OIC pilot, measure outcomes over 3-6 months, and use those results to open conversations with MASS-SPECC for regional distribution.
